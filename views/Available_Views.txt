Available Views
===============

FullCalendar has a number of different "views", or ways of displaying days and events.
The following 5 views are all built in to FullCalendar:

- **month** - [see example](/js/fullcalendar_views/month.html)
- **basicWeek** - [see example](/js/fullcalendar_views/basicWeek.html)
- **basicDay** - [see example](/js/fullcalendar_views/basicDay.html)
- **agendaWeek** - [see example](/js/fullcalendar_views/agendaWeek.html)
- **agendaDay** - [see example](/js/fullcalendar_views/agendaDay.html)

You can define [header](../display/header) buttons to allow the user to switch between them.
You can set the initial view of the calendar with the [defaultView]() option.

<p class='abstract' style='display:none'>
week, basicWeek, basicDay, agendaWeek, agendaDay
</p>
