Google Calendar
===============

FullCalendar can display events from a public [Google Calendar](http://calendar.google.com/).
It can serve as a backend that manages and persistently stores event data
(a feature that FullCalendar currently lacks).

**To get started, you must first make your Google Calendar public:**

1. In the Google Calendar interface, locate the "My Calendar" box on the left.
2. Click the arrow next to the calendar you need.
3. A menu will appear. Click "Share this calendar."
4. Check "Make this calendar public."
5. Make sure "Share only my free/busy information" is **unchecked**.
6. Click "Save."

**Then, you must obtain your calendar's XML feed URL:**

1. In the Google Calendar interface, locate the "My Calendar" box on the left
2. Click the arrow next to the calendar you need.
3. A menu will appear. Click "Calendar settings."
4. In the "Calendar Address" section of the screen, click the XML badge.
5. Your feed's URL will appear.

**Now it's time to initialize your calendar in JavaScript.**
You will use the `$.fullCalendar.gcalFeed` function with the `events` option, like so:

	$(document).ready(function() {
	
		// page is now ready, initialize the calendar...

		$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
			events: $.fullCalendar.gcalFeed(
				"http://www.google.com/your_feed_url/"
			)
		});
	
	});

If you wanted to import more than one Google Calendar, you would use the
[eventSources](event_data/eventSources) option instead.



Options
-------

You can tweak the way FullCalendar imports your Google Calendar events through these options:

- **className** - CSS class to attach to each event
- **editable** - whether to allow dragging/resizing (default: `false`)
- **currentTimezone** - a string like "America/Chicago".
  Consult [http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php](http://php.net/manual/en/timezones.php) for a full list.
  
Here is an example of how you'd use these options:

	$('#calendar').fullCalendar({
		events: $.fullCalendar.gcalFeed(
			"http://www.google.com/your_feed_url/",
			{
				// put your options here
				className:       'gcal-event',
				editable:        true,
				currentTimezone: 'America/Chicago'
			}
		)
	});



Timezones Gotchas
-----------------

Sometimes it can be confusing as to why FullCalendar displays event times differently than the Google Calendar interface.
There are the two factors involved in this:

- *the calendar's timezone*, accessed through "Calendar settings" after clicking the arrow next to the calendar's name
- *your Google Account's timezone*, accessed through the "Settings" link at the top right of the Google Calendar screen (near the "Sign out" link)

When both timezones are the same, you should have no problems. When they are different, FullCalendar will display times in the *calendar's* timezone.
Thus, times will be different than what you see in the Google Calendar interface because they are being adjusted to the GMT of the calendar.
The solution is to use the `currentTimezone` option. If this is set to the same timezone as your Google Account, all dates should appear consistent.
